Recursive Descent Parsing is a Top-Down method of syntax analysis in which a set of recursive procedures to process the input is executed. A procedure is associated with each non-terminal of a grammar. Top-Down parsing can be viewed as an attempt to find a leftmost derivation for an input string. It attempts to construct a parse tree for the input starting from the root and creating the nodes of the parse tree in preorder. Recursive Descent Parsing involves backtracking.
